# E-CAMPUS MANAGMENT IN C++ USING-OOP APPROACH
Campus Management System is a project that is designed for efficient data storage, analysation, and report generation with great ease. This program will allow user to maintain different institution faculty and student details. With just a mouse click one can easily access all of the vast student information, details and academic records as well as the relevant university faculty related details and information. Different reports can be generated based upon the vast information related to students and faculty teachers. The details include university information and details, subject queries, personnel details of the students, academic records and the same goes for the faculty etc. A manual management system requires a lot of manpower and a lot of time is consumed but here all of the work is computer based, hence the precision is maintained. Our program has two modes of access: faculty and student. User can choose the mode of accessibility depending upon whether heâ€™s a student or a faculty member.
